# The blog on omg.lol

Here we have the beginning of (yet) another blog that can be authored in _markdown_. 

## Other places I can be found
I've got a handful of other places on the _fediverse_ that I exist.
- [Mastodon main](https://social.targaryen.house/@swrogers)
- [Mastodon secondary](https://social.lol/@swrogers)
- [Friendica](https://venera.social/profile/swrogers)
- [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/i/web/profile/339569517325848576)

I've got others, [catodon](https://catodon.social/@swrogers) (because I really like the interface), [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/swrogers) (though that might go away...) and a [withknown](https://known.swrlab.org/) self hosted site (because I'm a glutton for punishment) - but I think that's good for now.

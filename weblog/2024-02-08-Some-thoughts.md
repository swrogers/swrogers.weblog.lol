# Some thoughts
I like the simplicity of being able to post in markdown, though I think what I might attempt here is using org-mode to export out to markdown and upload to a git repo. I think that might work here. Perhaps. Who knows. I also do like that omg.lol provides for photo hosting, so I could see using that feature here on the blog side as well...and maybe pushing that over to pixelfed. Or maybe pulling in pixelfed here via rss/atom/whatever....thoughts and phrases.
